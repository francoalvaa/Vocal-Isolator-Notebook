# Vocal-Isolator-Notebook

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that we can use as a voice isolator, a powerful tool that leverages the yt-dlp and spleeter libraries to separate vocals from instrumental tracks. By combining these advanced audio processing libraries, the notebook aims to extract the vocal components from a mixed audio source, providing a clear and isolated representation of the human voice.

Overview
In many audio recordings, such as songs or podcasts, vocals and instrumental tracks are mixed together. The purpose of this notebook is to utilize yt-dlp and spleeter, two popular libraries in the open-source community, to perform vocal isolation.

yt-dlp:
yt-dlp is an enhanced version of the popular YouTube-DL library that allows downloading audio and video content from various platforms, including YouTube. It provides a wide range of options and flexibility to retrieve audio data from online sources.

spleeter:
Spleeter is a powerful library built on top of the Deezer Research source separation engine. It utilizes deep learning techniques to separate audio sources from a mixed signal. Spleeter's pre-trained models can effectively separate vocals and instrumental tracks, even in complex and densely mixed audio sources.
